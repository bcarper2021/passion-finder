Script that scrapes Wikipedia and finds uncommon words that are shared across the articles provided

The idea of the script is that for people with many interests, they can input the names of all the wikipedia articles relating to their interests and the script will print uncommon words that are shared across all the articles. In theory, this would give insight on possibly what areas the inputted topics had points of intersection. The user would be able to find their passion by looking in the middle of the venn diagram of all of their interests.
